                    <h1>The Best Way to Reach Penn</h1>
                    <p>
                        We are The Daily Pennsylvanian, the newspaper by and for the students of the University of Pennsylvania. When our readers open “the DP” every morning, they open a world of campus and city news, feature stories, sports, commentary, advertising, and much
                        more. Whether in our daily newspaper, our weekly magazine, our special issues, or our websites, The Daily Pennsylvanian is the fi rst read for the Penn community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In an era when we often hear about the struggles of mass-market commercial newspapers and about students only getting their information online, The Daily Pennsylvanian thrives as a community newspaper because we remain relevant to our audience of devoted
                        readers. And for our advertisers, that’s why we are a proven and eff ective way — and still the best way — to reach Penn. We off er multiple media in print, online and out-of-home that reach diff erent segments of the Penn
                        market, from students to faculty/staff to parents and alumni, allowing you to choose the medium or media mix that best suits your advertising needs.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Paper Sizes:</b> The Daily Pennsylvanian prints its publications in two sizes. A full-size broadsheet newspaper is 12” wide by 21” tall with a maximum printed area per page of 10.875” wide by 20” tall. A tabloid pull-out is 10.5” wide by 12” tall with a maximum printed area per page of 9.046” wide by 10.5” tall.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Ad Sizes:</b> Sizes are expressed as the number of columns wide by the number of inches tall (i.e. a “2 x 4” ad is 2 columns wide by 4 inches tall). Multiplying columns by inches gives the total number of column inches (i.e. 2 x 4 = 8 column inches). Multiplying column inches by the ad rate gives the ad cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any ad size can be created according to these rules:

                        <li>Widths are in full columns (no half-columns or fractions)</li>

                        <li>Minimum size: 2 col. inches (1 col. x 2” or 2 col. x 1”)</li>
                        <li>Broadsheet ads taller than 17” will be charged and run as a full page ad (20” tall). Tabloid ads taller than 8.5” will be charged and run as a full page ad (10.5” tall).</li>
