		<div>Newsflash: Saturday is Philadelphia International Hand Drumming Day at Center City’s University of the Arts. Events start at 10 a.m., ranging from Arab percussion master classes to a Cajon drum circle. The day winds down with the Philadelphia Hand Drumming Panel in the afternoon, but the thing that sounds like the most fun (and is totally free) is the Cuban dance party concert that kicks off at 7. It ends at 9, so you can’t exactly dance the night away, but it might be a nice start to your evening debauchery.</div>
		<div>Where: Penn Park</div>
		<div>Where: Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts, 3680 Walnut St.</div>

		<div>Join the all-female South Asian women’s a cappella group for their spring performance of a medley of top 40, traditional songs and jazz hits. It’s also the release show for their third studio album.</div>
		<div>Go because: South Asian women a cappella is quite the niche, and you want to be a part of it.</div>
		<div>The Story: Best-selling author and journalist Malcolm Gladwell visited Penn on Wednesday night for a brief talk followed by a Q&A session.
His Point: Gladwell once again sought to provoke the Penn student body. Gladwell cited statistics that suggested that the Penn administrators take advantage of the tax system. He encouraged students to stand up against the funds that benefit them but undermine the legitimacy of the higher education system in America.
Reaction: Although Penn students were not previously aware of the exact figures, they did not necessarily come as a surprise. This was not the first time Gladwell has come to Penn to make far off remarks. The last time he visited, he advised the students to boycott the football team.
</div>
		<div>When: Friday 4/10 at 6:30 p.m.; Saturday 4/11 at 8:00 p.m.</div>
		<div>A Chi Oh no</div>
		<div>Manayunk StrEAT Food Festival</div>
		<div>Human BBQ XXXVII</div>
		<div>TOP STORIES</div>
		<div>Where: Houston Hall</div>
		<div>The Story: After a Penn parent called the University regarding an event hosted by Alpha Chi Omega that involved drinking, the sorority was subject to sanctions by the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life.
Aftermath: The sorority decided not to abide by the punishments by the University. Instead, it decided to revoke its charter and move off campus — becoming yet another addition to the off-campus Greek scene that the administration considers to be a nuisance.
Penn’s Reaction: Despite recent scandals, Penn has not changed the way that it promotes Greek life to prospective students. While giving tours, Kite and Key members describe Greek life as a positive way to get involved on campus.
</div>
		<div>Pilam is throwing their 37th annual BBQ with all the human (and some vegan) BBQ you can eat. There will also be a great lineup of alumni bands—including a secret set—to get stoked about.</div>
		<div>Cost: </div>
		<div>Malcolm Gladwell raises eyebrows</div>
		<div>Counterparts Presents: Parts and Recreation</div>
		<div>Penn spends exorbitant amounts in attorney fees for five-year legal fight</div>
		<div>TEDxPenn</div>
		<div>Go Because: You’re daring enough to try Pilam’s self proclaimed “human meat”—and want to see some killer bands while doing so.</div>
		<div>Check out Penn’s premiere jazz and pop a cappella group for their spring performance inspired by the popular TV show starring Amy Poehler. Featuring songs by Sam Smith, Amy Winehouse and more.</div>
		<div>The Lawsuit: Penn researchers were sued for breeding mice with a particular mutation for Alzheimer's research.
The Case: Opponents argued that Penn researchers were not authorized to use this type of mouse and infringed on patents.
The Outcome: Penn had to forfeit hundreds of thousands of dollars in attorney fees to prove their innocence which was proclaimed on May 2.
</div>
		<div>Where: 3914 Spruce Street</div>
		<div>WEEKEND GUIDE</div>
		<div>Go because: There aren’t many other shows like this one. And this is probably as close as you’ll ever get to meeting Amy Poehler in real life.</div>
		<div>Penn alum’s Rolling Stone story officially retracted</div>
		<div>When: Saturday 4/11, 12pm–12am</div>
		<div>When: Friday 4/10 at 6:00 p.m.; Saturday 4/11 at 8:30 p.m.</div>
		<div>The Story: The news article published in Rolling Stone in November entitled “A Rape on Campus” which delineated the chilling details of an alleged gang rape of a girl named “Jackie” at a Phi Kappa Psi party at the University of Virginia.
The Scandal: Rolling Stone’s account of the incident, written by the former managing editor of 34th Street Magazine at Penn, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, provoked widespread fear and discontent with Greek life and the university’s handling of rape cases.
Case of Phi Kappa Psi: The claims of “Jackie” could not be corroborated by anyone else. Also, the fraternity did not host an event on the night she alleges she was raped. Once the accountability of the story began to break down, Erdely released her own apology.
The Aftermath: After the details of the story were examined by the journalism school at Columbia University, they failed to add up properly. Phi Kappa Psi now plans to pursue legal action against Rolling Stone and Erdely on grounds of defamation.
</div>
		<div>Cost: $15 gets you all the BBQ and bands you can handle</div>
		<div>Where: Iron Gate Theater, 3700 Chestnut St.</div>
		<div>GPA may not be as important as you think</div>
		<div>Let’s get real: you don’t have moves. When you’re dancing at the club, it’s less dancing and more hopping up and down semi-rhythmically. The Community Education Centername okay (a performing arts center and “artists incubator space” that you definitely didn’t know about until now) is going to change your life. Get a group together, pitch in a couple bucks each (it’s $10 for the whole group), and learn Flamenco dancing. BYO castanets. Not actually.</div>
		<div>Cost:</div>
		<div>Penn HOLI</div>
		<div>The Findings: In certain fields, research has shown that GPA may not be a make or break factor for applicants. For a lot of employers, what is on the resume is what makes the applicant more/less competitive.
The Catch: At particular investment firms, however, GPA may still carry a lot of weight with prospective employers. But for future lawyers, law school remains to be a numbers game.
Why the curve is not such a disadvantage after all: All engineering students can take a breather about the ruthless curves that often plague their GPAs. Prospective employers of engineering students often put more weight on projects.
